# 🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis Project — AtliQ Grands

## 📘 Project Overview
In today’s competitive hospitality industry, **data-driven decision-making** has become essential for business growth.  
This project focuses on **AtliQ Grands**, a well-established hotel chain in India operating across **Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad**.

Despite being in the industry for nearly two decades and offering diverse hotel types — from luxurious *AtliQ Palace* to business-class *AtliQ Seasons* — the company recently faced a **significant decline in revenue and market share** due to rising competition.

To tackle this challenge, AtliQ Grands decided to **leverage data analytics** to extract valuable insights from its **booking database**, containing crucial information about:
- Customer bookings  
- Revenue  
- Cancellations  
- Occupancy rates  
- Room types  
- Booking platforms (e.g., MakeYourTrip, LogTrip, Tripster, AtliQ’s website)

## 🔍 Step 1: Data Exploration
The project began with an in-depth **exploration of raw datasets** to understand structure, volume, and interrelations.  
Using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, key business metrics were analyzed, including:

1. Identifying unique property IDs in booking data  
2. Calculating total bookings per property  
3. Detecting overbooked days (when bookings exceeded room capacity)  
4. Finding properties with the highest room capacity  

This phase uncovered **patterns and bottlenecks** in hotel operations, setting a strong foundation for the next steps.

## 🧹 Step 2: Data Cleaning
After exploration, the focus shifted to improving **data quality and consistency**.

Using **Pandas** functions and **statistical imputation**, I:
1. Identified and treated missing values using mean/median based on data distribution  
2. Filtered out invalid records (e.g., bookings > capacity)  
3. Ensured all fields adhered to business logic and accuracy  

Result: A **clean, structured, and reliable dataset** ready for advanced analytics.

## 💡 Step 3: Insight Generation
Once the data was clean, I performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualizations using **Matplotlib** to derive **actionable business insights**.

Key analyses included:
1. **Average Occupancy Rate** across cities and room categories  
2. **Weekday vs. Weekend Performance** — identifying high-demand days  
3. **Monthly Trends** — occupancy and revenue changes over time  
4. **Revenue by City and Hotel Type** — pinpointing high-performing locations  
5. **Customer Ratings** by city — revealing service quality insights  
6. **Revenue Share by Booking Platform** — identifying profitable partnerships  

A dynamic **August data integration** simulated real-world data updates, showcasing scalability and adaptability.
